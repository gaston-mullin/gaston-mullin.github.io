    "We now investigate how conditional choice probability methods can be extended to the estimation of dynamic games. We focus on an entry and exit game, a canonical example within the IO literature that has been used frequently in applied work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic structure of the game is as follows:\n",
    "- Time $t$ is discrete, with $t = 1,2,\\dots,\\infty$.\n",
    "- There are $I$ firms in each market $m$, with $N_m$ markets total.\n",
    "- The environment is stationary (choice probabilities, state transitions, and flow utilities only depend on time through the realization of the state variable in that period).\n",
    "- Each period, firms (simultaneously) make decisions about whether to enter the market (if they are currently out of the market) or permanently exit the market (if they are currently an incumbent). A firm that exits that market is replaced next period by a potential entrant.\n",
    "- Firms have private information about their payoffs through an identically and independtly distributed random variable $\\epsilon_{jt}^{(i)}$ for each period $t$, firm $i$, and choice $j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary difference between the single-agent framework and the multi-agent framework is that both agents' flow utilities and the evolution of state variables is determined by the realizations of the actions of all players. To account for this, our notation will adjust following Arcidiacono and Miller (2011) to \"big\" and \"little\" notation: \"big\" notation (capital letters) denotes flow utilities $U^{(i)}$, choice probabilities $P$, and state transitions $F_j$ for firm  conditional on the realizations for opponents' actions . Because these terms condition on the outcomes of decisions that firm  will not know when they make their own choice, due to the simultaneity of decisions, we need to integrate over the distributions of the vector of choices in order to obtain the \"little\" notation that we have used in previous notes."
